Overview

This repository contains the complete workflow for designing and analyzing a 145 MHz half-wave dipole antenna. It includes:

1. LaTeX report and source files documenting the theory, design, methodology, and results
2. MATLAB code for simulating impedance, return loss, VSWR, gain, and radiation patterns
3. Plots and figures generated from MATLAB simulations
4. Final compiled PDF report: Antenna Analysis and Simulation – Dipole Antenna Design at 145 MHz 

The goal of this project is to validate theoretical antenna predictions using MATLAB simulations and provide a clear, engineering-oriented analysis of dipole performance at VHF frequencies.
